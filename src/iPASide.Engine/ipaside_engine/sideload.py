"""End-to-end sideload orchestration.

A single reusable ``run_sideload`` that provisions, signs, installs, and records
an IPA - used both by the ``sideload`` command and by auto-refresh (which replays
a recorded install with its original options). Progress is reported through a
callback so callers can stream ``provision -> sign -> install`` phases to a UI.

Also owns the lifetime of what signing produces: the ``<source>_Signed.ipa`` that
can optionally be kept, the throwaway scratch directory beside it, and the
reporting/cleanup of a folder full of kept IPAs.
