// ── Transactional upgrade: move aside, verify, then commit ────────────────────────
// An upgrade replaces ~215 MB of app plus bundled engine in place. When that only
// half-applies - a truncated download, a crash mid-copy, a payload that shipped
// broken - the user is left with a folder that looks installed but cannot sign
// anything, and no route back. So an upgrade is staged instead of applied blind:
//
//   ssInstall      If a previous install is present, RENAME {app} aside. A rename
//                  within one volume only rewrites directory metadata, so it costs
//                  milliseconds where copying 215 MB aside would cost minutes. Inno
//                  then installs into a clean, empty {app}.
//   ssPostInstall  PROVE the new payload runs, then either discard the backup or put
//                  it back under its own name.
//
// A first install has nothing to move aside and nothing to fall back to, so it passes
// through here untouched.
//
// %LOCALAPPDATA%\iPASide - the Apple ID session, the signing certificate and private
// key, the anisette state and the sideload registry - is never part of any of this.
// Only {app} ever moves, and the only thing written under the data root is install.log.
//
// One measured limit to know before rearranging this: by the time Setup reaches
// ssPostInstall the install is already committed as far as Inno is concerned. Raising
// an exception there still exits 0 and still leaves the Add/Remove entry written, so a
// rolled-back upgrade cannot report itself through the exit code. What it can do, and
// does below, is put the working version back, say so on the final page, and leave a
// record on disk. (The in-app updater launches Setup detached and interactively, so
// the final page - not the exit code - is what a user actually sees.)
